        <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            Junior Full-Stack developer seeking a role that will allow me to contribute to the
            success, growth, and culture of a company, offers a thriving workplace, and
            opportunities to grow professionally and technically. Completed a full-time,
            intensive, 3-month coding bootcamp November 2019, and am currently working as a
            contractor with SageNet as a Test & Turn Up Technician. I landed an entry-level
            development position at Avis and lost it shortly due to COVID’s hard hit on the
            company. I am eager to get my foot back in the door for a career in development.
